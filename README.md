# How to use
This repo is all the homework assignments for 
(Introduction to Programming Concepts)

This is not meant to be a cheat sheet for lazy individuals, but as a way to follow the learning flow of being introduced to programming concepts. 

## How to see the assignments requirements
I've added the word document that contains the assignments we were given in each weeks folder.

Each ".cpp" file is an individual exercise.

## A warning to other students
Your only hurting yourself if you use this repo irresponsibly. I am putting this here for those who want to learn and potential employers that want proof of code etc.
